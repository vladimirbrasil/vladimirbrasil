- 👋 Hi, I’m Vladimir Dietrich (@vladimirbrasil)
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development using pure html (currently I need to use lit-html) and, for now, firebase.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to migrate javascript to typescript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack developments that do not rely on react, at least for now I prefer pure html. 
Why? Because I want to use advanced features of html. This approach makes me loose 99% of job opportunities.
I still don't know for sure if it is a good approach.
- 📫 You can reach me by email: vladimir.brasil@gmail.com
